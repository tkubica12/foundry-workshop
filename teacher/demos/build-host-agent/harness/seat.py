"""Resolve the environment contract this lab needs, from whichever source is present.

Your seat holds a Foundry project, a set of shared model references, a local model
deployment and a responsible AI policy. The lab needs to know all four, and where those
values live depends on how your environment was prepared. Rather than hardcode one
answer, an explicit file uses only its own values and explicit command-line overrides.
Without a file, legacy resolution uses environment variables and the well-known seat
file written when the machine was built.

The first source that supplies a value wins, so you can override any single field on the
command line without rewriting the rest. If nothing supplies a required value the error
names the field and every place that was searched, because "endpoint is None" three
frames deep is a worse start to a lab than a sentence telling you what to set.
