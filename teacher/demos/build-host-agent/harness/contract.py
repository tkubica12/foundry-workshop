"""Deterministic contract used to score model output in the Chapter 2 lab.

The lab asks you to choose between two models on evidence rather than on how fluent
the answer reads. That only works if scoring is mechanical, so this module turns the
stock-triage task into pass or fail criteria that never depend on taste.

Every check is lexical. It reads text, it does not understand it. That is a deliberate
limit: the harness flags candidates, and you confirm one flagged output yourself before
recording a decision. Where a check cannot find a claim at all it reports "not stated"
rather than guessing, because a silent answer and a wrong answer fail for different
reasons and deserve different follow-up.
