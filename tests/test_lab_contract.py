"""Tests for the deterministic stock-triage contract used in the Chapter 2 lab.

These tests protect the property the lab depends on: the same output always produces
the same score, for every attendee, on every run. They also pin the known limits of
lexical checking, so nobody later mistakes the harness for comprehension.
