"""Chapter 2 lab harness: choose a model on evidence, then prove a policy changed behaviour.

Run the steps in order:

    python lab.py preflight     confirm access, warm the client, claim your run identifier
    python lab.py contract      score both assigned models on the synthetic task
    python lab.py guardrail     show a named policy changing what an agent may answer
    python lab.py decide        record your release decision and its limitation
    python lab.py card          print the completed evidence card
    python lab.py cleanup       delete every agent this run created

Each step writes what it observed to the evidence card, so a failure part way through
still leaves you with the evidence gathered up to that point.

Two things in here are deliberate and worth knowing before you read the code. Every timed
run makes a throwaway warm-up call first, because acquiring a token and opening
connections costs several seconds that belong to your machine rather than to the model,
and measuring them as model latency is how people end up reporting a platform as ten
times slower than it is. And every agent this run creates is named with your run
identifier, so the traces you find later are unambiguously yours in a room of thirty.
